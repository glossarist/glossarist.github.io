# Term Types

ISO 12620 / TBX `term_type` classification for [designations](/docs/model/designations). Each designation can carry a `term_type` that classifies what kind of term it is — orthographic variants, symbolic notations, or usage/provenance categories.

## Usage

The `term_type` field is set on individual designations within a localization:

```yaml
termid: "3.1.1.1"
eng:
  terms:
    - type: expression
      designation: "entity"
      normative_status: preferred
      term_type: full_form
    - type: abbreviation
      designation: "ENT"
      normative_status: admitted
      term_type: initialism
```

Multiple designations for the same concept can have different term types, allowing the concept to be known under different forms.
